# Inventory System Migration Guide

## Overview
The inventory system has been migrated from a separate inventory lot tracking system to a **GRN-based inventory system**. This provides a single source of truth and eliminates data duplication.

---

## Architecture Change

### Before (Old System)
```
PO → GRN → Create Inventory Lot → Track Movements
                    ↓
            Separate inventory table
            Stock movements
            Transfers
            Alerts
```

### After (New System)
```
PO → GRN → Inventory (derived from GRNs)
           ↓
    Single source of truth
    No data duplication
    Real-time accuracy
```

---

## What Changed

### Backend

#### 1. Routes (`server/src/routes/inventoryRoutes.js`)
**Before:**
- Multiple routes for inventory lots, movements, transfers, alerts
- Separate inventory management system

**After:**
- Single route: `GET /api/inventory` → redirects to GRN-based inventory
- All other routes deprecated

#### 2. Controller
**Before:**
- `inventoryController.js` with lot management

**After:**
- Uses `grnController.getInventoryProducts()`
- Aggregates data from GRNs in real-time

#### 3. Data Flow
**Before:**
```javascript
// Separate inventory lots
InventoryLot.find({ status: 'Active' })
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Derived from GRNs
GRN.find() → Aggregate by PO line item → Filter fully received
```

---

### Frontend

#### 1. API Service (`client/src/services/inventoryAPI.js`)
**Before:**
- Full CRUD operations for inventory lots
- Stock movements, transfers, alerts

**After:**
- `getAll()` redirects to GRN-based endpoint
- All other methods deprecated with console warnings
- Backward compatible (won't break existing code)

#### 2. Inventory Page (`client/src/pages/Inventory.jsx`)
**Before:**
- Displayed inventory lots
- Stock movement modals
- Transfer functionality

**After:**
- Displays fully received products from GRNs
- Grouped by category
- Per-category pagination
- Search highlighting

## Benefits

### ✅ Single Source of Truth
- Inventory is always derived from GRNs
- No sync issues between systems
- Real-time accuracy

### ✅ No Data Duplication
- Don't maintain separate inventory lots
- Reduces storage and complexity
- Easier to maintain

### ✅ Better Tracking
- Each PO line item tracked separately
- Handles multiple line items for same product
- Accurate completion status

### ✅ Scalability
- Handles 1000s of products
- Per-category pagination
- Efficient queries

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Deprecation (Current) ✅
- [x] Mark old inventory routes as deprecated
- [x] Add console warnings to deprecated API methods
- [x] Redirect main inventory endpoint to GRN-based system
- [x] Update frontend to use new system

### Phase 2: Cleanup (Future)
- [ ] Remove deprecated routes after 3 months
- [ ] Remove `inventoryController.js`
- [ ] Remove `InventoryLot` model
- [ ] Remove deprecated API methods
- [ ] Archive old inventory data

### Phase 3: Complete Migration (Future)
- [ ] Remove all references to old system
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Train users on new system

| `POST /api/inventory/:id/movement` | Returns deprecation message | ⚠️ Deprecated |
| `POST /api/inventory/transfer` | Returns deprecation message | ⚠️ Deprecated |
| `GET /api/inventory/alerts/*` | Returns deprecation message | ⚠️ Deprecated |

### Frontend API
| Method | New Behavior | Status |

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Backend Rollback
```bash
# Revert inventoryRoutes.js to previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 server/src/routes/inventoryRoutes.js

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Rollback
```bash
# Revert Inventory.jsx to previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 client/src/pages/Inventory.jsx

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

## Support

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Inventory page shows no products
**Solution:** Check that GRNs are marked as complete and products are 100% received

**Issue:** Product shows wrong quantity
**Solution:** Verify PO line items are correctly linked in GRN items

**Issue:** Console warnings about deprecated methods
**Solution:** Update code to use GRN-based methods instead
