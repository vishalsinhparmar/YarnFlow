# üéØ **INVENTORY BUTTONS EXPLAINED - Complete Guide**

## üîç **UNDERSTANDING YOUR CONFUSION**

You're seeing dummy data because **your database is empty**! Inventory lots are not created manually - they come from the GRN (Goods Receipt Note) process. Let me explain everything clearly:

---

## üìã **HOW INVENTORY LOTS ARE ACTUALLY CREATED**

### **‚úÖ Real Business Process:**
```
1. Create Purchase Order (PO) ‚Üí 2. Receive Goods ‚Üí 3. Create GRN ‚Üí 4. Approve GRN ‚Üí 5. Inventory Lot Auto-Created
```

**Inventory lots are automatically created when you approve a GRN!** You don't manually create them.
