# 🚀 Safe Deployment Checklist - Environment Configuration

## 📋 Pre-Push Verification Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Verify What Changed
Run this command to see what files you modified:
```bash
git status
```

**Expected changes:**
- ✅ `client/src/services/common.js` (environment auto-detection)
- ✅ `client/.gitignore` (added .env files)
- ✅ `client/.env.development` (local API URL)
- ✅ `client/.env.production` (Railway API URL)
- ✅ `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (documentation)
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (this file)

---

## 🔍 What Could Break in Production?

### ❌ Potential Issues:

1. **Issue**: `.env` files accidentally pushed to GitHub
   - **Risk**: API URLs exposed publicly
   - **Prevention**: Already added to `.gitignore` ✅
   - **Verify**: Run `git status` - `.env` files should NOT appear

2. **Issue**: Vercel doesn't have environment variables set
   - **Risk**: Frontend won't know which API to connect to
   - **Prevention**: Must set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel Dashboard
   - **Action Required**: After deployment, add env vars in Vercel

3. **Issue**: CORS errors from Railway backend
   - **Risk**: Vercel frontend can't connect to Railway backend
   - **Prevention**: Need to update CORS in Railway server
   - **Action Required**: Update backend CORS configuration

4. **Issue**: Breaking existing production deployment
   - **Risk**: Current production stops working
   - **Prevention**: Using a feature branch (not main)
   - **Safe**: ✅ Changes won't affect production until merged

---

## 🌿 Step 2: Create Safe Branch

**Branch name**: `feature/environment-config`

Run these commands:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd c:\Users\vishalsinh\YarnFlow

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/environment-config

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

**Expected output**: `* feature/environment-config` (asterisk shows current branch)

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test Locally BEFORE Pushing

### Test 1: Development Mode
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Check browser console for: `🌐 API Mode: DEVELOPMENT`
- [ ] Check browser console for: `🔗 API URL: http://localhost:3050/api`
- [ ] Try creating a product/supplier - should work with local server

### Test 2: Production Build (Local)
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No warnings about missing environment variables
- [ ] Check `dist` folder is created

### Test 3: Preview Production Build
```bash
cd client
npm run preview
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Preview starts on a port (e.g., http://localhost:4173)
- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Should show: `🌐 API Mode: PRODUCTION`
- [ ] Should show: `🔗 API URL: https://yarnflow-production.up.railway.app/api`

---

## 📤 Step 4: Push to GitHub

**Only proceed if all tests above passed!**

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add automatic environment detection for API URLs

- Auto-detect development vs production environment
- Add .env.development for local API (localhost:3050)
- Add .env.production for Railway API
- Update .gitignore to exclude .env files
- Add Vercel deployment guide
- Prevent accidental API URL commits"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/environment-config
```

---

## 🔐 Step 5: Verify Git Security

After pushing, verify `.env` files are NOT in the repository:

```bash
# Check what was actually pushed
git ls-tree -r feature/environment-config --name-only | grep .env
```

**Expected output**: Should show ONLY `.env.example` (NOT .env.development or .env.production)

**If you see .env.development or .env.production:**
```bash
# Remove them from git (but keep locally)
git rm --cached client/.env.development
git rm --cached client/.env.production
git commit -m "Remove .env files from git tracking"
git push origin feature/environment-config
```

---

## 🌐 Step 6: Vercel Deployment Setup

### Before Deploying to Vercel:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Import your project** from GitHub
3. **Configure Root Directory**: Set to `client`
4. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - Name: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - Value: `https://yarnflow-production.up.railway.app/api`
   - Environment: ✅ Production, ✅ Preview

### After First Deployment:

- [ ] Open deployed Vercel URL
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Verify: `🔗 API URL: https://yarnflow-production.up.railway.app/api`
- [ ] Test: Try loading products/suppliers page

---

## 🔧 Step 7: Fix CORS on Railway Backend (If Needed)

If you get CORS errors after Vercel deployment, update your Railway backend:

**File**: `server/src/index.js` or `server/src/app.js`

```javascript
import cors from 'cors';

// Update CORS configuration
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',           // Local Vite dev
    'http://localhost:4173',           // Local Vite preview
    'https://your-app.vercel.app',     // Your Vercel domain
    'https://*.vercel.app'             // All Vercel preview deployments
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

**After updating:**
```bash
cd server
git add .
git commit -m "Update CORS to allow Vercel domain"
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy the backend changes.

## ✅ Final Verification Checklist

Before considering this complete:

### Local Development:
- [ ] `npm run dev` works
- [ ] Connects to `http://localhost:3050/api`
- [ ] Can create/read/update/delete data

### Production Build:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `npm run preview` works
- [ ] Shows production API URL in console

### Git Security:
- [ ] `.env.development` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.production` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env` files NOT visible in GitHub repository

### Vercel Deployment:
- [ ] Environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set
- [ ] Deployment succeeds
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] API calls work (check Network tab)

### Railway Backend:
- [ ] CORS allows Vercel domain
- [ ] Backend is running
- [ ] Can receive requests from Vercel

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "VITE_API_BASE_URL is undefined"
**Solution**: 
1. Check Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Make sure variable name is exactly `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (case-sensitive)
3. Redeploy after adding the variable

### Problem: CORS error in production
**Solution**: Update Railway backend CORS configuration (see Step 7)

### Problem: API calls fail with 404
**Solution**: 
1. Verify Railway backend is running
2. Check API URL is correct: `https://yarnflow-production.up.railway.app/api`
3. Test API directly in browser or Postman

### Problem: Changes not reflecting in Vercel
**Solution**: 
1. Trigger a new deployment in Vercel Dashboard
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if correct branch is deployed
