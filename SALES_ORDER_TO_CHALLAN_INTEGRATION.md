## ðŸ”§ **FIXING YOUR CURRENT VALIDATION ERROR**

I can see you're getting "Validation Error: Failed to update sales order". Let me fix this:

### **Issue:** Missing required fields in update

### **Solution:** Update the validation to handle partial updates

```javascript
// The update should allow partial field updates
// Your current order has all required data, so this should work
```

Let me check what's causing the validation error and fix it:

### **Quick Fix for Your Current Order:**

1. **Check Required Fields:**
   - âœ… Customer: Lagom Cosmetics Private Limited
   - âœ… Expected Delivery Date: 14-10-2025
   - âœ… Total Amount: â‚¹1.2K
   - âœ… Items: Present (showing tax amount â‚¹179.82)

2. **The Error Might Be:**
